Verse
Em   G      A      Em      G      A       Em
   I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel
  G    A        Em      G      A          Em
I focus on the pain the only thing that's real
    G      A       Em       G      A       Em
The needle tears a hole the old familiar sting
       G      A      Em         G      A      D
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything

Chorus
Em              C   G            D
What have I become?  My sweetest friend
Em          C          G          D
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
    Em                 C    D              D
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Em              C      D
I will let you down    I will make you hurt

Inter
Em | G  A | Em | G  A

Verse
I wear this crown of thorns, upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time the feelings disappear
You are someone else, I am still right here

Chorus

Outro
   Em               C     D              D
If I could start again  a million miles away
Em              C    D              Em
I would keep myself  I would find a way
