Verse
G
  Welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind
  C                              G
  Tethered to another and you're worried all the time
      D                              C     Gadd11/B Am
  You always knew the melody but you never heard it rhyme
  She's fair and she is quiet, Lord, she doesn't look like me
  She made me love the morning, she's a holiday at sea
  The New York streets are as busy as they always used to be
G                        D     G
  But I am the mother of Evangeline

  The first things that she took from me were selfishness and sleep
  She broke a thousand heirlooms I was never meant to keep
  She filled my life with color, cancelled plans and trashed my car
  But none of that is ever who we are
  Outside of my windows are the mountains and the snow
  I hold you while you're sleeping and I wish that I could go
  All my rowdy friends are out accomplishing their dreams
  But I am the mother of Evangeline

Middle-8
                D                                 C                G
  They've still got their morning paper and their coffee and their time
       D                                   C                  G
  They still enjoy their evenings with the skeptics and their wine
         B7                                 C     Gadd11 Am
  Oh but all the wonders I have seen I will see a second time
       G                               D
  From inside of the ages through your eyes

  You were not an accident where no one thought it through
  The world has stood against us, made us mean to fight for you
  And when we chose your name we knew that you'd fight the power, too
  You're nothing short of magical and beautiful to me
  I would never hit the big time without you
  So they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine
G                          D     Em
  Cause I am the mother of Evangeline
  C                                      C       Gadd11 Am
  They can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine
G                          D     G
  Cause I am the mother of Evangeline

  C D G
  Ooooh... (3x)
